# STEP 1: FIND IDEAL RATIO
# remember the height/width are often modified by aspect ratio
# ID_VIDEO_ASPECT, ID_VIDEO_WIDTH, ID_VIDEO_HEIGHT
# they might not be set right away! i.e., "-frames 0" or midentify will mislead
# look for output like: VO: [vdpau] 720x480 => 854x480 Planar YV12
#
# calculate new ideal size for X & Y aspects
#   Y in above is the same
#   but X changes, so calculate, e.g.: 854*704/720 = 835.0222
#   rounding, original res is: 835x480
#   therefore ideal ratio is: 1.73958333
#
# STEP 2: SCALE DOWN
#
# turn this into smaller, codec-friendly 16-divisible dimensions
#
# check script here http://sandy.hirstory.com/sandy/res.php?x=704&y=480
# script is old! needs cleaning up!
# thoughts behind script:
#  - ideal ratio = that of content sans black bars (often weird, nonstandard)
#  - desired = multiples of 16, as close to standard A/R as practical
# algorithm:
#  - iterates every pair of 16-multiples, 16-3200
#  - only shows pairs with <=0.05 deviation from either 4/3, 16/9, or the content ideal
# output:
#  - 4/3 & 16/9 are blue
#  - shows count of total pixel footprint, bolded if inside ideal range (150~300k)
#  - ratio bolded if result will produce either top+bottom bars, or VERY small sidebars
#    (ratio smaller than ideal = shorter X, longer Y = bars on sides)
#    (ratio larger than ideal = longer X, shorter Y = bars on top + bottom)
#  - next to either the x or y, is the implied breakdown of content pixels vs bars
#    for instance:
#       (187.73)(4.27)192x128                -- will have 4.27 total columns of black
#                     192x144(13.09)(130.91) -- will have 13.09 total rows of black
#
# finally you will end up with an ideal filter chain like:
# -vf crop=704:480:8:0,scale=501:288,dsize=512:288
