This is a set of settings/tweaks/scripts/config files 
to be installed on top of vanilla Arch Linux installs,
for my own convenience. :)

Generally, I use this package for several computers at 
once, so to coordinate things I have a VPS-hosted http 
repository, and a script that automatically does makepkg, 
some integrity checks, and repo-add. I usually sshfs-mount 
the VPS under ~/fuse/remote-repo-dir. In order to deploy 
my changes, I just need to type this on the dev computer:

	./package-this ~/fuse/remote-repo-dir

and on any computer with the custom repo in pacman.conf:

	pacman -Sy proterozoic

It uses a LOT of hacks in the install script and elsewhere 
in order to modify files owned by other packages and 
still keep some consistency/integrity. Just think of it as 
an automation of all the crap I always do to make myself at 
home on a new box. In other words, it's my years of sysadmin 
experience encapsulated in about 12kb.

One hack you may notice right away: in order to automate the 
many incremental deployments I do, the version number is 
actually the timestamp at which i ran makepkg.

It's under heavy development. I'm trying my best to give it 
"completeness" but there are still a lot of rough edges where 
trying to deploy it on a strange system without knowing all 
the details and caveats will almost certainly FAIL HORRIBLY 
and possibly cause SUFFERING and/or MAYHEM. Someday I hope 
for this to change, but for now, you've been warned.

The package name refers to Earth's geological era after the 
Archean period, in which life began as moldy growths on the 
sides of rocks. That is a metaphor - Arch is the rocks, and 
my package is the mold.
